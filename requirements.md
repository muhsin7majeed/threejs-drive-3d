# Driving Sandbox (Arcade Physics) - Requirements

## üéØ Goal

Build an **arcade-style driving sandbox** using **React Three Fiber** and **Rapier** where the player controls a 3D car in a physics-enabled environment.  
The experience should feel **smooth, snappy, and fun** rather than hyper-realistic.  
Think: drifting, responsive steering, and satisfying camera follow.

---

## üöó Core Gameplay

- Player drives a single car around a 3D environment.
- Car responds to **physics** (collisions, friction, gravity).
- **Rear-wheel torque** provides acceleration.
- **Front wheels steer** left/right, affecting the car‚Äôs movement direction.
- Driving feel is **arcade-like** (forgiving, responsive), not simulation.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Stack

- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** ‚Üí rendering & scene management.
- **@react-three/rapier** ‚Üí physics engine integration.
- **GLTF car model** with **separate wheels** for animation.
- **Keyboard input** (Arrow keys or WASD).

---

## üîë Features

### Phase 1 (MVP)

- Render 3D scene with ground plane, lighting, and skybox.
- Load a GLTF car model with separate wheels.
- Create a rigidbody chassis for the car.
- Add colliders:
  - Box collider for chassis.
  - Cylinder/sphere colliders for wheels (or raycast wheels).
- Keyboard input:
  - ArrowUp / W ‚Üí apply torque (accelerate).
  - ArrowDown / S ‚Üí brake/reverse.
  - ArrowLeft / A ‚Üí steer left.
  - ArrowRight / D ‚Üí steer right.
- Apply torque to **rear wheels** only.
- Rotate **front wheels (Y-axis)** for steering.
- Rotate **all wheels (X-axis)** to match movement speed.
- Smooth **chase camera** that follows behind car.

### Phase 2 (Polish)

- Add **linear + angular damping** to make driving smoother.
- Reduce steering angle at high speeds.
- Add **friction** and **drift factor** to prevent hovercraft feel.
- Add **center of mass adjustment** to reduce flipping.
- Add collisions with simple environment props (walls, ramps, cubes).
- Add particle effects:
  - Dust/smoke when drifting or braking.
  - Skid marks on sharp turns.

### Phase 3 (Stretch Goals)

- Terrain/road environment (heightfield collider).
- Multiple cars / AI traffic.
- Audio feedback (engine rev, drift sounds, collisions).
- Speedometer UI overlay.
- Reset car if it flips upside down.
- Simple checkpoint or lap-based system (optional).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas

- Wheels need **separate groups** for spin (X) and steer (Y).
- Keep **units consistent** (1 unit = 1 meter).
- Use **impulses/torque**, not manual position setting.
- Cap **max velocity** to avoid infinite acceleration.
- Lower **center of mass** for stability.
- Clamp **sideways velocity** for arcade-style grip.
