## Driving Sandbox Requirements

Source of truth: [requirements.md](mdc:requirements.md)

- **Goal**: Build an arcade-style driving sandbox with smooth, responsive feel.
- **Core gameplay**:
  - Physics-driven car (collisions, friction, gravity)
  - Rear-wheel torque for acceleration
  - Front-wheel steering; all wheels spin with speed
  - Smooth chase camera
- **Tech stack**: React Three Fiber, @react-three/rapier, GLTF car (separate wheels), keyboard input (WASD/Arrows).

### Milestones
- **MVP**: Ground plane, lighting/skybox, car model, rigidbody + colliders, rear-wheel torque, front-wheel steer (Y), wheel spin (X), basic inputs, chase cam.
- **Polish**: Linear/angular damping, speed-sensitive steering, friction/drift factor, center of mass tweak, simple props, particles (dust/skids).
- **Stretch**: Terrain/road, AI/multiple cars, audio, UI speedometer, flip-reset, checkpoints/laps.

### Key Guidelines (Arcade feel)
- Prefer impulses/torque over manual transforms.
- Cap max velocity and clamp sideways velocity for grip.
- Lower center of mass for stability; add damping.
- Separate wheel groups for spin (X) vs steer (Y).

### Useful search terms
- `@react-three/rapier rigidbody`, `applyTorqueImpulse`, `raycast vehicle physics`
- `ackermann steering geometry`, `react-three-fiber chase camera`
- `rapier linear damping angular damping`, `car drift physics`
